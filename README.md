Factory Logistics Optimization Simulator

Requests from manufacturing companies have brought upon a need to optimize factory logistics through tracking of automated guided vehicles (AGVs). The client for this project, A&E Engineering, exists to deliver custom industrial automation solutions to customers worldwide. Their services include factory automation, real-time locating systems (RTLS) and radio-frequency identification (RFID) deployment, manufacturing execution system (MES) deployment, and more. This company has reached out and tasked the team with creating a virtual test environment, which will address the needs of manufacturing companies who are seeking to optimize the AGVs their factory.  

The virtual test environment will contain the layout of the factory and all the components. The components of this simulation include: AGVs, a recharge area, consumption points, a delivery area, and paths. The AGVs will pick up and deliver goods within the factory using simulated demand by following predetermined paths. The AGVs, as well as their paths and consumption points will need to be configurable to test optimal algorithms. These algorithms are tested to improve delivery time between consumption points, reduce traffic between devices in the simulation, and optimize battery usage.

How to use:

Start drawing a path by pressing 'a' continue adding points to the path by hovering mouse over where you want the point

End the path drawing by pressing 'd' 

Reset the path and clear the screen by pressing 'r'

Clear the path by pressing 'c'.



As of now:

Red rectangles = Obstacles

Green rectangles = Pickup points

Blue rectangles = Dropoff points
